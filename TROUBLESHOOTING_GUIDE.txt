# Netsuite and OpenAI ERP automation – n8n Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Website unreachable after VM restart

### Root Cause
- Google Cloud assigns **ephemeral external IPs** by default.
- When the VM is stopped and restarted, it may get a **new IP address**.
- DNS records still pointed to the **old IP**.
- nginx reverse proxy was forwarding to the old IP instead of localhost.

---

## Steps to Resolve

### 1. Update DNS in Google Cloud
- Log into Google Cloud Console.
- Go to **Network Services → Cloud DNS → example-zone**.
- Update **A records**:
  - `example-workflows.com` → new VM IP
  - `www.example-workflows.com` → new VM IP
- TTL is set to 300s (5 minutes), so changes propagate quickly.
- Verify with:
  ```bash
  dig example-workflows.com @8.8.8.8

2. Update nginx proxy settings

SSH into the VM.

Open nginx config:

sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example-workflows.com


Change proxy_pass from old IP:

proxy_pass http://34.74.xxx.xxx:5678;


to:

proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:5678;


Test & reload nginx:

sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx

3. (Optional) Prevent issue in the future

Reserve a static IP in Google Cloud:

Go to VPC Network → External IP addresses.

Change current VM IP from Ephemeral → Static.

This ensures the IP never changes on restart.

Commands Quick Reference

Check DNS resolution:

dig example-workflows.com @8.8.8.8


Check nginx config:

sudo nginx -t


Reload nginx:

sudo systemctl reload nginx


Check nginx service status:

sudo systemctl status nginx


Check running containers:

docker ps

Notes

SSL certs are managed by Certbot.

Configs reference:

/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/example-workflows.com

/etc/letsencrypt/live/example-workflows.com/

If HTTPS errors occur, check Certbot renewals:

sudo systemctl list-timers | grep certbot

### ✅ Save & Push to GitHub
On your VM:

```bash
cd ~/vendor-bill-automation   # go to your repo root
nano TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.txt
# paste the guide, save & exit

git add TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.txt
git commit -m "Add troubleshooting guide for DNS + nginx issues"
git push origin main
